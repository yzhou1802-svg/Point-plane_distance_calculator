# Point-plane_distance_calculator
This is a very simple calculator, which can directly calculate the distance between a given point and a plane. The first demo version has only the ability to use parameter form of the plane.
You can not only quickly find out the plane function through giving three diffrent points, but also know the function of grades. And it is easy to use.
